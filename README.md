# SVM Diabetes Prediction

This repository contains a Python implementation of a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model for predicting diabetes based on the Diabetes Dataset.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate an SVM classifier that predicts whether a person has diabetes based on several health-related attributes, including age, BMI, insulin levels, and more.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set). It consists of 8 features and a binary target variable:
- **Features**: Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age
- **Target**: Outcome (0 = No diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy

You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
